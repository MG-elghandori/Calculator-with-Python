## Calculator-with-Python

The calculator is an application that aims to perform simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was programmed using the Python language and the Tkinter library to create the graphical user interface.

The code for the calculator was organized using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which means that the program was divided into independent objects that interact with each other. There are objects for the graphical interface, objects for the operation buttons, and objects for displaying the results.

Basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using user-input parameters and executing the appropriate operations. There are also additional functions such as clearing the screen.

In general, the program allows the user to input numbers and perform arithmetic operations through a user-friendly interface. The results are displayed on the screen and can be viewed by the user.
